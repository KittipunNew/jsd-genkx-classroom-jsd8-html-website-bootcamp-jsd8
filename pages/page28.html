        <p>Hi, my name is Rawisut. I have a passion for coding and technology, which is why I decided to enroll in Generation Bootcamp to gain new skills and prepare for a career change. I've always been interested in finding creative solutions and love the problem-solving aspect of programming. Outside of tech, I'm an avid dog lover, and spending time with them always brightens my day. I also enjoy watching anime and reading manga, as it allows me to dive into different worlds and stories. In my free time, I like to relax by watching YouTube videos, whether it's tech content, anime reviews, or something fun and entertaining.</p>
